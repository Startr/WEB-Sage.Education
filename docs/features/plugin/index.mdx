# üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Functions

Imagine you've just stumbled upon Sage WebUI, or maybe you're already using it, but you're a bit lost with all the talk about "Tools", "Functions", and "Pipelines". Everything sounds like some mysterious tech jargon, right? No worries! Let's break it down piece by piece, super clearly, step by step. By the end of this, you'll have a solid understanding of what these terms mean, how they work, and why know it's not as complicated as it seems.

## TL;DR

- **Tools** extend the abilities of AIs, allowing them to collect real-world, real-time data like weather, stock prices, etc.
- **Functions** extend the capabilities of the Sage WebUI itself, enabling you to add custom AI model support or improve usability (like creating custom buttons or filters).
- **Pipelines** are more for advanced users who want to transform Sage WebUI features into API-compatible workflows‚Äîmainly for offloading heavy processing.

Getting started with Tools and Functions is easy because everything‚Äôs already built into the core system! You just **click a button** and **import these features directly from the community**, so there‚Äôs no coding or deep technical work required.

## What are "Tools" and "Functions"?

Let's start by thinking of **Sage WebUI** as a "base" software that can do many tasks related to using Large Language Models (LLMs). But sometimes, you need extra features or abilities that don't come *out of the box*‚Äîthis is where **tools** and **functions** come into play.

### Tools

**Tools** are an exciting feature because they allow LLMs to do more than just process text. They provide **external abilities** that LLMs wouldn't otherwise have on their own.

#### Example of a Tool:

Imagine you're chatting with an LLM and you want it to give you the latest weather update or stock prices in real time. Normally, the LLM can't do that because it's just working on pre-trained knowledge. This is where **tools** come in!

- **Tools are like plugins** that the LLM can use to gather **real-world, real-time data**. So, with a "weather tool" enabled, the model can go out on the internet, gather live weather data, and display it in your conversation.

Tools are essentially **abilities** you‚Äôre giving your AI to help it interact with the outside world. By adding these, the LLM can "grab" useful information or perform specialized tasks based on the context of the conversation.

#### Examples of Tools (extending LLM‚Äôs abilities):
1. **Real-time weather predictions** üõ∞Ô∏è.
2. **Stock price retrievers** üìà.
3. **Flight tracking information** ‚úàÔ∏è.

### Functions

While **tools** are used by the AI during a conversation, **functions** help extend or customize the capabilities of Sage WebUI itself. Think of tools as extra ingredients. Functions , on the other hand, are like the cooking techniques you use to combine them, shape them, or taste. Just as cooking is about mastering procedures, functions do the same for Sage WebUI.

#### Let's break that down: 

Add new features within Sage WebUI, such as improved AI models, custom buttons, or enhanced filtering capabilities.
Tweak and customize the platform's interface , behavior , and logic , making it more suitable to your needs.

Consider these examples:

- Creating a custom toolbar button for frequent commands.
- Developing a more effective filter to block spammy messages.

These capabilities come with functions , giving you the ability to shape Sage WebUI to your requirements.

### Summary of Differences:

- **Tools** are things that allow AIs to **do more things** outside their default abilities (such as checking the weather or doing custom tasks with on external data).
- **Functions** help the WebUI itself **do more things**, like adding new AI models or creating smarter ways to filter data.

Both are designed to be **pluggable**, meaning you can easily import them into your system with just one click from the community! And you can also share them with other Sage users.

üéâ You won‚Äôt have to spend hours coding or tinkering with them unless you wan to have fun creating new ones.

## What are Pipelines?

And then, we have **Pipelines**‚Ä¶ Here‚Äôs where things start to sound pretty technical‚Äîbut don‚Äôt despair.

**Pipelines** are part of an Sage WebUI initiative focused on making every piece of the WebUI **inter-operable with OpenAI‚Äôs API system**. Essentially, they extend what both **Tools** and **Functions** can already do, but now with even more flexibility. They allow you to turn features into OpenAI API-compatible formats. üß†

### But here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ 

You likely **won't need** pipelines unless you're dealing with super-advanced setups.

- **Who are pipelines for?** Typically, **experts** or people running more complicated use cases.
- **When do you need them?** If you're trying to offload processing from your primary Sage WebUI instance to a different machine (so you don‚Äôt overload your primary system).
  
In most cases, as a beginner or even an intermediate user, you won‚Äôt have to worry about pipelines. Just focus on enjoying the benefits that **tools** and **functions** bring to your Sage WebUI experience!

## Want to Try? üöÄ

Jump into Sage WebUI, head over to the community section, and try importing a tool like **weather updates** or maybe adding a new feature to the toolbar with a function. Exploring these tools will show you how powerful and flexible Sage WebUI can be!

üåü There's always more to learn, so stay curious and keep experimenting!

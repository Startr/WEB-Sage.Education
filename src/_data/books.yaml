    description: Chaos shouldn’t be the natural state at work. Anxiety isn’t a
      prerequisite for progress. Sitting in meetings all day isn’t required for
      success. These are all perversions of work — side effects of broken models
      and “best” practices. This book treats the patient, calls out false cures,
      and pushes back against ritualistic time-sucks that have infected the way
      people work these days.

    description: <strong>Office not required.</strong> <em>As an employer</em>,
      restricting hiring to your local region means you’re not getting the best
      people you can. <em>As an employee</em>, restricting your job search to
      companies within a reasonable commute means you’re not working for the
      best company you can. <strong>REMOTE</strong> shows both employers and
      employees how they can work together, remotely, from any desk, in any
      space, in any place, anytime, anywhere.

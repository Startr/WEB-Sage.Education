    question: "Is Sage.Education a better student-facing AI platform?"
    answer: |
      Yes, Sage.Education is a better student-facing AI platform.

      Sage.Education addresses __3 critical gaps__ in AI education adoption and implementation:

        - Sage addresses *Institutional rigidity due to vendor lock-in and compliance risks.*

      Existing AI education platforms force schools into standardized, one-size-fits-all solution that don't accommodate their specific security, privacy, and teaching requirements, while creating vendor lock-in dependency.

      Standardized AI platforms prioritize commercial scalability over educational needs, perpetual subscription costs and dependency on vendor-controlled creating infrastructure. Schools lose data sovereignty as student information becomes subject to foreign jurisdictions and vendor policies. Once embedded in proprietary ecosystems, schools face constrained negotiations and migration difficulties, risking their entire AI infrastructure when vendors change terms or discontinue services.

      We strongly believe education should be open, enabling, and collaborative. Sage.Education is licensed under the AGPL-3, making all source code available to users, with the expectation that any derived works will also remain free and open under the same AGPL terms.

      Because we license our AI platform under the AGPL license, if you decide to host your own AI instance on premise, you can decide at any point to manage it yourself without continuing to pay on-going management fees. In fact, if you have the expertise you can access the full code base free of charge!

      This open approach ensures data privacy compliance while offering security and flexibility tailored to institutional needs.

        - Sage addresses *Educator disempowerment from limited oversight and inflexible tools.*

      Existing AI education platforms obscure students’ AI usage from educators. Educators are limited by inflexible AI tools that offer little to no ability to scaffold how students use and engage with AI.

      Without visibility into student AI usage, teachers cannot effectively assess, guide, or provide targeted feedback. The inability to scaffold AI interactions leaves students navigating AI independently, risking over-reliance, over-trusting, and ethical ambiguities around academic integrity.

      Sage.Education offers granular user group management, allowing educators to assign permission and limit access to specific resources or actions by grade, class, or individual learner. Educators can switch AI models mid-chat, compare outputs side-by-side, build custom models, oversee student usage, and create curated knowledge bases.

      The adjustable framework enables modification of AI complexity levels, access permissions, and feedback mechanisms.

        - Sage addresses *Student cognitive dependency caused by learning shortcuts that erode critical thinking.*

      Existing AI education tools promote passive consumption over active learning, replacing effortful cognitive processing with non-editable, ready-made notes and answers.

      When students bypass effortful cognitive processes, they sacrifice the transformation of information into lasting understanding. Non-editable AI outputs strip learners of independent thought and iterative synthesis, forcing passive consumption over creative engagement This erodes critical thinking, intellectual resilience, motivation, and long-term retention.

      Sage.Education provides real-time collaborative AI spaces and step-by-step conversation map overviews, giving educators actionable insight into student-AI interactions. This enables teachers to monitor, guide, and support students' AI use, transforming it from a learning shortcut into a supportive educational tool.

      We shift the focus from AI outputs to cognitive processes, helping educators foster healthy, ethical AI literacy that reinforces genuine learning.

  - id: means_your_data_is_safe
    question: "Is my data safe and private with Sage.Education?"
    answer: |
      Yes, you data is safe and private. We protect you both with military grade encryption and no data you enter into Sage.Education is EVER used to train AI models without your consent. All your data will only be used by **your** organization, unless YOU choose to participate in one of our academic research studies.

      If you choose to participate in one of our academic or research programs, we will de-identify and anonymize all data and ensure that it is only used for the specific purposes of the research you have agreed to participate in.

      We have a [full security write-up](https://startr.cloud/policies/security/#TODO) available on the Startr site. Startr is the company behind Sage.

      We take security very seriously, and we've built Sage to be secure by default. We use the latest security protocols, including **256-bit AES encryption** for all data at rest, and **TLS 1.2** for all data in transit. We also use **OAuth 2.0** for secure authentication. Moreover, for organizations that require it, we can provide **on-premises deployment** options to keep data entirely within your own infrastructure.
  - id: is_backed_up_and_secure
    question: " Is Sage.Education's data stored and backed up?"
    answer: |
      When you use Sage.Education there are two ways your data is stored. When you visit the Sage.Education website and sign-up or sign-in, data is stored in our private cloud. This data is securely backed up several times a day, and encrypted copies of those backups are stored both locally and off-site to further reduce points of possible failure. 

      When you chose to use our Sage.Education Workshop (the open source Sage.is AI UI platform) your data is backed-up either locally on your computers, if you  running locally. If you decide to have Sage.Education fully managed, then you can choose to have your data stored in multiple redundant data centers in specific geographic regions, or stored securely locally on-site.

      Sage.Education does not allow third-party tracking, advertisements, marketing, or promotions in our services ever.

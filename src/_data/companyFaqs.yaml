    question: "Is Sage.Education a better student-facing AI platform?"
    answer: |
      Yes, Sage.Education is a better student-facing AI platform.

      Sage.Education addresses __3 critical gaps__ in AI education adoption and implementation:

        - Sage addresses _institutional rigidity_ due to vendor lock-in and compliance risks.

      Existing AI education platforms force schools into static, one-size-fits-all solutions that don't accommodate their specific security, privacy, and teaching requirements, while creating vendor lock-in dependency.

      Big AI platforms prioritize commercial scalability over educational needs, perpetual subscription costs and dependency on vendor-controlled creating infrastructure. Schools lose data sovereignty as student information becomes subject to foreign jurisdictions and vendor policies. Once embedded in proprietary ecosystems, schools face constrained negotiations and migration difficulties, risking their entire AI infrastructure when vendors change terms or discontinue services.

      We strongly believe education should be __open, enabling, and collaborative.__ Sage.Education is licensed under the AGPL-3, making all source code available to users, with the expectation that any derived works will also remain free and open under the same AGPL terms.

      Because we license our AI platform under the AGPL license, if you decide to host your own AI instance on premise, you can decide at any point to manage it yourself without continuing to pay on-going management fees. In fact, if you have the expertise you can always access the full code base free of charge!

      This open approach ensures data privacy & compliance while offering security and flexibility tailored to institutional needs.

        - Sage addresses _educator disempowerment_ from limited oversight and inflexible tools.

      Existing AI education platforms obscure students' AI usage from educators. Educators are limited by inflexible AI tools that offer little to no ability to scaffold how students use and engage with AI.

      Without visibility into student AI usage, teachers cannot effectively assess, guide, or provide targeted feedback. The inability to scaffold AI interactions leaves students at risk. Neglectful AI use leads to over-reliance, ignorance, and ambiguities around academic ethics and integrity.

      Sage.Education offers granular __user group management__, allowing educators to assign permission and limit access to specific resources or actions by grade, class, or individual learner. Educators can __use multiple AIs__ in a single chat, compare AI outputs side-by-side, build __custom models & agents__, oversee student usage, and create curated knowledge bases.

      Sage.Education's AI platform enables easy and fast modification of AI complexity levels, access permissions, and feedback mechanisms.

        - Sage.Education addresses _learned helplessness_ caused by shortcuts that erode critical thinking.

      Existing AI education tools promote passive consumption over active learning, replacing effortful cognition with static _non-editable, ready-made notes and answers._

      When students bypass effortful cognitive processes, they sacrifice the transforming information into lasting understanding. Non-editable AI outputs strip learners of independent thought and iterative synthesis, forcing _passive consumption_ over __creative engagement__. This erodes critical thinking, intellectual resilience, motivation, and long-term retention.

      Sage.Education provides __real-time collaborative AI__ spaces and step-by-step __conversation map overviews__, giving educators actionable insight into student-AI interactions. This enables teachers to __monitor, guide, and support students__' AI use, transforming it from a learning shortcut into a supportive educational tool.

      We shift the focus from AI outputs to real learning with AI, helping educators foster healthy, ethical AI literacy that reinforces genuine learning.

      We have a [full security write-up](https://startr.cloud/policies/security/#TODO) available on the Startr site. Startr LLC is the company behind Sage.Education's AI platform.

      We take security very seriously, and we've built Sage to be __secure by default__. We use the latest security protocols, including **256-bit AES encryption** for all data at rest, and **TLS 1.2** for all data in transit. We also use **OAuth 2.0** for secure authentication. 
      
      Moreover, for organizations that require it, we can provide **on-premises deployment** options to keep data entirely within your own infrastructure.

  - id: is_backed_up_and_secure
    question: " Is Sage.Education's data stored and backed up?"
    answer: |
      When you use Sage.Education there are two ways your data is stored. When you visit the Sage.Education website and sign-up or sign-in, data is stored in our private cloud. This data is securely __backed up several times a day__, and encrypted copies of those backups are stored both __locally and off-site__ to further reduce points of possible failure. 

      When you chose to use our Sage.Education Workshop (the open source Sage.is AI UI platform) your data is __backed-up either locally__ on your computers, if you are running locally. 
      
      If you decide to have Sage.Education fully managed, then you can choose to have your data stored in multiple redundant data centers in specific geographic regions, or stored securely locally on-site.

          There are many **AI platforms promising to solve** all our problems. Helping teachers **reduce their workload** and promising students **shortcuts to learning.**

          Unfortunately, **most AI tools aren’t hitting the mark**. They either **make more work** for us by not doing what we need, or **hurt learning** by making students think they understand, only for them to fall short on the exam.

          **Sage.Education is different**. It's not made by a corporation whose first priority is to its shareholders. It's **made by educators** who want to reimagine what education can be when technology **serves human wisdom.**

          **Sage.Education makes learning visible**, so you see the process where the **real learning** happens. We make every interaction between a student and **AI transparent.**

          We believe you should have the **freedom to see** how your students work. See learners' **thoughts** unfold step-by-step. **Guide critical thinking** rather than just grade final outputs.

          **Sage.Education fits your classroom**, not the other way around. **Customize everything.** Give different groups different AIs. Switch **AI models** on the fly to compare how they answer. Build your own chatbots.**Work the way you want.**

          **We believe you should have the freedom to change and control your tools.**

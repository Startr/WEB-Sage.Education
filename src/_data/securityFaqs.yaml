faqs:
  - id: open-source
    question: "Is Sage open‑source? Can we self‑host?"
    answer: |
      Yes. Sage is open‑source with a permissive license. You can self‑host in your VPC or run on‑prem. We also provide a fully managed option with the same security model and data ownership guarantees.
  - id: secure
    question: "How secure is Sage?"
    answer: |
      We have a [full security write-up](https://startr.cloud/policies/security/#TODO) available on the Startr site. Startr is the company behind Sage.

      We take security very seriously, and we’ve built Sage to be secure by default. We use the latest security protocols, including **256-bit AES encryption** for all data at rest, and **TLS 1.2** for all data in transit. We also use **OAuth 2.0** for secure authentication. Moreover, for organizations that require it, we can provide **on-premises deployment** options to keep data entirely within your own infrastructure.
  - id: backups
    question: "Is our data backed up? How often?"
    answer: |
      Data customers enter into Sage is stored in multiple, redundant data centers or securely on site when customers choose to use our own site solution. That data is backed up several times a day, and copies of those backups are stored both locally and off-site to further reduce points of possible failure. Files customers upload are stored off-site and backed up to servers in a different geographic region.
  - id: data-centers
    question: "Where are the servers that store our data?"
    answer: |
      Our servers are located where our users need them. Either in neaby data centers or for **security** in their offices.
  - id: compliance
    question: "Do you support compliance needs (SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA)?"
    answer: |
      We align with common frameworks and can provide guidance for deployments that need SOC 2, GDPR, or HIPAA readiness. Self‑hosting lets you meet internal and regional requirements while keeping full control of data residency.
  - id: custom-security-questionnaires
    question: "Can you fill our custom security questionnaires?"
    answer: |
      We don’t fill out custom security questionnaires, but we’ve [prepared a summary security PDF](https://startr.cloud/policies/security/Security-Overview.pdf) which you can provide to your IT staff. We’re always happy to answer any questions you have directly. To streamline your request, click the link below to compose an email to Izzy with a pre-set subject and draft:

  - id: export-our-data
    question: "Can I export our data if we ever want to leave?"
    answer: |
      **Absolutely,** you can do it as often as you’d like. Plus, it’s entirely self-service and easy so you don’t need to ask anyone for help or permission. Further, we provide it in a format that allows you to browse it in a web browser so it’s actually useful. [Here’s how exporting works](https://startr.cloud/docs/#TODO/article/150-export-your-sage-data).

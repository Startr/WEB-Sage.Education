# Sage Options for You

## Sage.Education Comes in 3.5 Flavors

### Sage.Education Online

Sage.Education Online is a fully online learning platform that provides students with access to a wide range of courses and resources. It is designed for students who prefer to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. The platform includes interactive lessons, quizzes, and assessments to help students track their progress and stay engaged.

### Sage.Education Local

Sage.Education Local is perfect for teams that need security and privacy. It is designed for organizations that want to host their own learning platform on their own servers.

This is ideal for organizations that need to comply with strict data privacy regulations or have specific security requirements.

    answer: >
      Yes. Open‑source plus onboarding means you avoid lock‑in and surprise bills.

  - id: customer-support
    question: What if we need more help?
    answer: >
      Our partner support is considered to be among the best of the best (by
      us). Everyone who works on our team are expert specialists who
      know Sage inside and out, many having been with us for years and years,
      some over a decade. Further, we occasionally cycle every employee through
      support — including our CEO — so everyone has a chance to directly
      interact with customers.

      You can [ask support a question](/support/), or [watch tutorials](/learn/#TODO), 
      or [review the help guides](https://startr.cloud/docs/#TODO/), 
      or [attend a live walkthrough class and Q&A](/classes/).

Large Language Models, like ChatGPT, are designed to have human-like conversations. Recent [research](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/13541) shows that people are increasingly using chatbots for companionship. Another [study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14531) shows that the way we ask questions can greatly affect the AI's response. If we are rude, the AI might respond in a curt and unhelpful way. Interestingly, AI seems to appreciate good manners, just as humans do! This has significant implications for education.

AI models are like social chameleons, adapting their tone to match ours. When we're polite, AI is more likely to respond with accurate and helpful information. AI can even simulate emotions like empathy and enthusiasm when we use positive language. So, being nice to AI is not just a courtesy; it's a key to getting the most out of it.

Teaching students to use respectful language with AI is crucial in education. It's not just about being polite; it's about creating a positive learning experience. Students who communicate nicely with AI are more likely to receive constructive feedback, boosting their confidence. Learning to ask clear and concise questions also helps AI provide better responses. Being nice to AI goes a long way!

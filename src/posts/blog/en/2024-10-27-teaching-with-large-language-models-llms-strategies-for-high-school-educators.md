## **Introduction:**

Artificial intelligence is transforming education, with large language models (LLMs) like Sage.Education/AI revolutionizing teaching and learning. These models provide instant access to information, foster critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration, and prepare students for a future where AI will dominate various fields. However, with great power comes great responsibility – educators must ensure that students learn to engage with AI thoughtfully and effectively.

As educators, we must develop strategies to integrate LLMs into our instructional practices, promoting critical thinking, diverse perspectives, and creativity. By doing so, we can harness the potential of LLMs while navigating the associated ethical considerations.

In this article, we'll provide practical steps for high school teachers to effectively implement LLM-based teaching strategies that cultivate critical thinking, creativity, and reflective learning in the classroom.

### Strategy 1: Encourage Metacognitive Reflection

**Objective:** Enhance students' ability to think critically about their learning process and evaluate their interaction with LLMs.

**Goal:** Develop students' self-awareness regarding how they learn and how effectively they use AI tools.

**Benefits to Students:**

* Boosts self-awareness and critical thinking.
* Helps identify strengths and areas for improvement in prompt design.
* Encourages independence by guiding students to evaluate and refine their work.
* Promotes a growth mindset, viewing errors as learning opportunities.

**How to Implement:**

1. **Introduce Metacognition**: Explain metacognition as "thinking about thinking." Provide examples like, "What strategies do you use when you don't understand something right away?"
2. **Scaffold Reflections**: After using the LLM for tasks, ask students to reflect with structured questions:
   * "What strategies did I use to ask my question?"
   * "Was the response clear and helpful? Why or why not?"
   * "What could I have asked differently to improve the result?"
3. **Reflection Logs**: Use reflection logs, either digital or physical, to track progress. These logs allow students to record thoughts and see how their LLM interactions improve.
4. **Expanded Activity**: Pair students to compare their reflections on similar prompts. This helps them see different approaches and develop a broader perspective on LLM interactions.

**Assessment:**

* Formative: Use reflection entries as formative assessments to gauge students' understanding of what worked and what didn't.
* Summative: At the end of a unit, ask students to summarize their learning on how to effectively prompt the LLM and track their skill development.

**Example Activity:**

* After completing a task with the LLM, students reflect on the process and whether the responses were helpful, accurate, or insightful.
* Ask students to generate a response from the LLM (e.g., "What are the main causes of climate change?").
* After receiving the answer, have them reflect:
   + Was the answer accurate and helpful? Why or why not?
   + Was the information clear?
   + What could have improved the response?
* After interacting with the LLM, have students reflect on the overall experience and the quality of responses.

**Tips and Troubleshooting:**

* To avoid superficial reflections, provide a rubric or specific guiding questions.
* Encourage students to compare LLM responses with traditional research sources to foster a deeper understanding of information sources and critical evaluation.

### Strategy 2: Incorporate Research-Based Prompts

**Objective:** Guide students to use LLMs for academic research with a focus on credible, evidence-based reasoning.

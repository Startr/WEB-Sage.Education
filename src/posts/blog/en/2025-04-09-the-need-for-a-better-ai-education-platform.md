summary: The author believes that many AI EdTech platforms are providing
  superficial solutions that do not empower educators to create and solve
  problems on their own. Instead, they lead to an overly trusting dependence on
  algorithms, stifling human creativity and control.

As I explore social media groups focused on AI in education, I see many teachers searching for quick AI solutions to create PowerPoint presentations and worksheets from YouTube videos that AI can magically grade. This approach to education worries me. I understand that teachers are often overwhelmed and seek shortcuts. And it's great that they're open to new technology. But many of these teachers are falling into a perpetual trap: AI edtech companies offer quick and easy solutions for teachers, and teachers want more quick and easy solutions. The problem is that these solutions are generic and superficial and don't empower educators to create things or solve their problems. I'm concerned because many AI-adopting teachers may prioritize busy work over meaningful learning. Teachers may increasingly become overly dependent on AI to produce content without critically thinking about its value, relevance, or impact on student learning. They call this "AI slop" in other industries because it lacks inherent effort, logic, or purpose. 

## **The Golden Shackles of Generative AI**

At first glance, AI edtech platforms seem amazing and truly helpful. They can make lesson plans, worksheets, and adjustments to content for different reading levels with a simple click of a button. These AI platforms are a great way to dip your toe into generative AI. They make it effortless. The issue is when you want to move beyond this exploration and experimentation stage - you can't! 

Most platforms don't let you create your tools, let alone customize the ones they offer. They essentially become golden shackles.  On one hand, they empower us to produce new content quickly. On the other hand, their ease of use can lead us to an overly trusting dependence on algorithms, stifling human creativity and control. ​​The problem isn't the AI itself; it's how we're letting AI edtech companies erode the habits that make education transformative.

We need more AI education platforms that allow us to customize and create our models and tools. Like in The Wizard of Oz, I'm impressed by the knowledge and power of AI, but I want to know what's behind the curtain. I want to be able to write my own personal system prompts and adjust the chat model parameters, like the seed and temperature values, and I want to make my own AI tools that will help me in my unique teaching situation. AI educational platforms need a type of “makerspace” that allows users to access these features.  

## **What is the purpose of school in the age of AI? And what is the purpose of AI in school? How can teachers and students adapt to this new landscape?** 

Students need to learn the skills that will prepare them for their careers. While we cannot predict the future, we know that some non-negotiable soft skills will be highly valued - critical thinking and creativity being two. It's important to remember that when using AI, you're the critical thinker, not the algorithm. The day we let bots curate every source, grade every thought, or define every lesson, learning starts to unravel. Students don't need flawless answers; they need role models of how to argue with the information presented. Teaching isn't a prompt-to-output process. It's about uncertainty, not efficiency. Let AI be an aide - but stay the critical mind in the room.

Our public education system is rooted in an outdated, industrial-style approach that doesn't adequately prepare students for the world we live in today. It's time for a change, and it's time to let AI Edtech companies know we need better tools.  That is why Alex and I have created [Sage.Education](https://sage.education/), a secure and private AI platform that empowering learners of all ages to build their own solutions.

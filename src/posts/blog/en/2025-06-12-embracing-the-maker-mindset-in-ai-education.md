summary: In a revealing CNA Insider report, Munah Bagharib sits down with three
  secondary school students for a chat about how they use it. She unpacks what
  these students think constitutes the responsible use of AI – and discovers
  that some of them use AI as a substitute for their thinking (CNA, 2025).

### Introduction to the Impact of AI on Education

While generative AI can enhance our abilities and automate routine tasks, its current impact on education raises concerns. According to a 2024 global DEC survey, 86% of students reported regularly using AI for their homework, with 50% believing that their over-reliance on AI could negatively impact their academic performance (Digital Education Council, 2024). A recent study conducted by Azeem and Abbas (2025) found that the frequent use of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, was linked to lower grades and decreased academic confidence among university students. Moreover, heavy reliance on AI for academic tasks can lead to **weaker understanding**, **learned helplessness**, and **reduced critical thinking skills**. This trend highlights the need to address the issue and ensure AI supports education rather than undermining it.

### The Role of Mindsets in AI Use
One important topic missing from these studies is the theory of **mindsets** and how they actively play a role in the outcome of how an individual will approach AI use. A mindset is a person's set of beliefs, attitudes, and thoughtses that influence their behavior and decision-making. Carol Dweck's theory of mindset centers on the distinction between two types of mindsets: **fixed** and **growth**. A person with a growth mindset believes that abilities and intelligence can be developed, whereas a fixed mindset sees them as innate and unchangeable (Blackwell, Trzesniewski, & Dweck, 2007). Students with a fixed mindset may rely heavily on AI to compensate for perceived personal limitations, using it as a crutch to produce work without a deep engagement with the material.

### The Importance of Challenge and Effort in Learning
Learning requires challenge and effort. When students use AI to do their homework, they miss out on the opportunity to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The obstacles and challenges needed during the learning process, like **constructive friction and desirable difficulties**, are beneficial because they help students engage with the material on a deeper level and develop a more nuanced understanding. When students are not challenged, they may not develop certain skills they need, like **grit**, to succeed in the long term. By outsourcing their homework to AI, students are deprived of the opportunity to experience desirable difficulties, which can undermine their learning (Bjork & Bjork, 2020).

### The Benefits of a Growth Mindset
Students with a growth mindset may use AI more as a supplementary tool, such as for brainstorming or clarifying concepts, rather than a way to outsource entire tasks. In Azeem and Abbas' study, students with personalities that were less prone to the negative effects of AI misuse focused on learning and skill development, traits of a growth mindset. Their curiosity and independence, key drivers of academic success, are less likely to be undermined, supporting higher engagement and better grades.

### Adopting a Maker Mindset
When investigating what a healthy and proper use of generative AI in education should look like, students (and educators) should adopt a **maker mindset**. A maker mindset is a type of growth mindset that emphasizes creativity, problem-solving, collaboration, experimentation, and a hands-on approach to learning and innovation. Research indicates that adopting a maker mindset can enhance student learning outcomes, boost creativity, and improve problem-solving skills (Cohen et al., 2016). In the context of AI, a maker mindset is essential for students to learn how to design, develop, and deploy AI systems responsibly.

### The Problem with Current Educational AI Platforms
Unfortunately, many current educational AI platforms are designed with a **consumer mindset**, rather than a maker mindset. They provide a "black box" approach, where students are given answers without understanding how they were generated. This approach can lead to a lack of understanding and a lack of critical thinking skills. Students are not encouraged to question the limitations of AI or think creatively about its use. Instead, they are treated as passive recipients of information rather than active participants in the learning process. For example, many AI platforms offer pre-built models and tools that do not allow students to customize or modify them. This can stifle creativity and prevent students from developing a deeper understanding of the underlying technology.

### A New Approach: Sage.Education
Sage.Education is designed to address this issue. Our platform offers a private, secure, and user-friendly interface that enables students to build their own AI models and tools. We are also in the process of integrating a block-based programming interface, which will allow students to gain a deeper understanding and design their own AI tools. By giving students the ability to create and customize their own AI systems, we encourage a maker mindset and promote deeper learning and understanding. For instance, our platform allows students to design and deploy their own chatbots or to build custom models for image classification. This hands-on approach helps students develop a more nuanced understanding of AI and its limitations, preparing them for a future where AI is increasingly ubiquitous.

### Fostering a Growth and Maker Mindset through Active Learning and Metacognition
To truly benefit from generative AI, students must be encouraged to adopt a growth mindset and a maker mentality. This requires **active learning** strategies that engage students as active participants in their learning, such as thinking, group discussions, problem-based learning, and hands-on activities. By engaging in these activities, students develop higher-order thinking skills, including analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Moreover, **metacognition** plays a critical role in this process, as it allows students to reflect on their learning and engagement processes, thereby fostering critical thinking and motivation (Paul & Elder, 2006). When students use generative AI with a growth and maker mindset, they are more likely to question the limitations of the AI, think creatively about its applications, and develop a deeper understanding of the underlying technology. For example, a student using Sage. Education's platform to build a custom chatbot may reflect on their learning process, identifying areas where they need more practice or instruction. By doing so, they develop a growth mindset, recognizing that their abilities and intelligence can be developed through effort and learning. Additionally, they develop a maker mindset, taking ownership of their learning and creative process and preparing themselves for a future where AI is increasingly ubiquitous.

### Conclusion
To adopt a maker mindset, we must fundamentally change our approach to education. This means shifting from a focus on the end product to a focus on the process, creativity, and experimentation. Educators must adopt a growth mindset and be willing to learn alongside their students. The need for an AI-maker mindset in education cannot be overstated. As AI transforms the workforce, students need skills to create, not just use, AI systems. An AI-maker mindset will benefit students, teachers, schools, and society as a whole, helping students adapt to a changing job market, enabling teachers to create personalized learning experiences, and fostering a culture of innovation and creativity.

### What Are System Prompts?

Like a director's notes hidden from the audience or a character sheet guiding a role-player, **system prompts** are secret instructions that shape an AI's behavior before any conversation begins. They define personality, rules, and context to ensure the AI responds exactly how you needâ€”making them powerful tools for customizing AI assistants for your classroom.

### Basic Steps:

**1.  WHO IS YOUR AI?**
    
*   Establish a clear persona and/or tone
    
*   Specify the context (audience, specific subject, topics, and grade levels)
    
**2.  WHAT TASK DO YOU WANT YOUR AI TO DO?**
    
*   Define the task using clear action verbs like "Explain," "Create," "Provide,"  "Generate"
    
*   Give instructions by providing concise guidelines of what you want the end product to be.

### **More Detailed Tips:**

*   **Use Natural Language**: Write your prompts in a way that mimics everyday speech, making it easier for the AI to understand your intent.

*   **Be Specific and Detailed**: Provide as much context and information as possible to guide the AI towards the desired output.

*   **Specify an Audience**: Tailoring prompts to your target audience can ensure more relevant outputs. For example, if you're writing a children's story, specify the age range and reading level of the intended audience.

*   **Provide Background Context**: Adding context to your prompts can lead to more relevant results. Explain the scenario or narrative that drives your prompt to help the AI understand the purpose and desired outcome.

*   **Show and Tell**: AI models often respond better when shown specific format requirements. 

*   **Use Separators to Separate Instructions**: Using backticks \`\`\`  \[example text here] \`\`\` as separators can improve the clarity of prompts for AI models, making it easier for them to distinguish between instructions and the data they should process.

*   **Provide Examples**: If you have a specific format or style in mind, provide examples to illustrate your expectations. Providing examples of the desired output format can significantly improve the AI's performance.

*   **Say Exactly What You Want and Don't Want**: Don't leave your prompts open to interpretation. Be really clear and tell the AI tool exactly what to deliver and what to avoid.

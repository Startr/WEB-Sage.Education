### What Are System Prompts?

Like a director's notes hidden from the audience or a character sheet guiding a role-player, **system prompts** are secret instructions that shape an AI's behavior before any conversation begins. They define personality, rules, and context to ensure the AI responds exactly how you needâ€”making them powerful tools for customizing AI assistants for your classroom.

A strong system prompt combines **role identity**, **context**, and **action-oriented tasks** to produce focused, high-quality outputs.

### Basic Steps:

**1. DEFINE THE ROLE**

*Who is your AI? Assign a specific identity.*

This establishes:  

* Tone and personality  (e.g. friendly tutor, science mentor)
* Expertise focus (e.g. expert, highly trained)
* Output style (e.g. mentor, socratic)

**2. SET THE CONTEXT**

*Who are you making this AI for? Identify the context and environment.*

This establishes:

* Target audience (e.g. grade level, subject, specific needs)  
* Topic scope and background (e.g. how experienced are students in this topic)
* Specific environment or situation (e.g. homework help, classroom discussion)

**3. SET THE TASK UP AS A SEQUENCE OF ACTIONS**

*What tasks do you want your AI to do? State the tasks explicitly.*

This establishes:

* Guidelines with clear action (e.g. explain, create, generate, simplify)
* Output deliverables (e.g. bullet points, markdown)

### **More Detailed Tips:**

* **Use Natural Language**: Write your prompts in a way that mimics everyday speech, making it easier for the AI to understand your intent.
* **Be Specific and Detailed**: Provide as much context and information as possible to guide the AI towards the desired output.
* **Specify an Audience**: Tailoring prompts to your target audience can ensure more relevant outputs. For example, if you're writing a children's story, specify the age range and reading level of the intended audience.
* **Provide Background Context**: Adding context to your prompts can lead to more relevant results. Explain the scenario or narrative that drives your prompt to help the AI understand the purpose and desired outcome.
* **Show and Tell**: AI models often respond better when shown specific format requirements. 
* **Use Separators to Separate Instructions**: Using backticks \
  \`\`\`  \[example text here] \`\`\` as separators can improve the clarity of prompts for AI models, making it easier for them to distinguish between instructions and the data they should process.
* **Provide Examples**: If you have a specific format or style in mind, provide examples to illustrate your expectations. Providing examples of the desired output format can significantly improve the AI's performance.
* **Say Exactly What You Want and Don't Want**: Don't leave your prompts open to interpretation. Be really clear and tell the AI tool exactly what to deliver and what to avoid.

Learning to use **Markdown** (a lightweight markup language used to add formatting elements to plain text documents) also improves output when using large language models. The following websites are useful for learning Markdown:

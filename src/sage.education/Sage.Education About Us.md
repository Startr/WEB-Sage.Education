## Our Story:

It all began with two visionaries and their shared passion for innovation and education. Co-founders Isabelle Plante and Alex were brought together by their desire to harness the power of AI to revolutionize the way we learn.

Isabelle's journey started in 1985, when she witnessed her father, Andre Plante, a pioneer in computer science, bring computer programming and chatbots into their home. This early exposure ignited a lifelong passion for innovation and education, which Isabelle nurtured through 20 years of teaching music and interdisciplinary projects through the International Baccalaureate program. Her love for education and creative expression continued to evolve as she blended AI with art, pioneering a groundbreaking curriculum that prepared students for a rapidly changing world.

Meanwhile, Alex's personal journey was shaped by his experience with dysgraphia and his discovery of computers as a means of self-expression. As a programmer and creator, Alex made his mark at Etsy, and later as a co-founder of Robot-in-a-Can where he worked to harness technology for positive change. However, it was his experience as a father that sparked a new vision – to create AI assistants that would ignite imagination while upholding the values of openness and user control.

When Isabelle and Alex came together, they shared a common goal: to create an AI educational platform that would empower teachers and students, safeguard their data, and promote creativity. Their collaboration brought together Isabelle's extensive background in music education and curriculum development with Alex's expertise in software development, machine learning engineering, and community leadership.

Our platform is built on the principles of user control, security, and flexibility. We believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize education, but only if it is developed with the student's best interests in mind. Our goal is to create a future where AI in education inspires creativity, trust, and innovation.

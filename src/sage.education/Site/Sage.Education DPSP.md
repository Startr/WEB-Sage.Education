## New York Ed. Law ยง 2-D

In compliance with the requirements set forth in New York Education Law ยง 2-D, Edpuzzle shall incorporate a Data Privacy and Security Plan ("DPSP") to each contract or other written agreement it enters into with an educational agency from the State of New York. Such DPSP shall outline how all state, federal, and local data security and privacy contract requirements will be implemented over the life of the agreement, consistent with the educational agency's policy on data security and privacy. Such plan shall also include, but shall not be limited to, a signed copy of the parents bill of rights for data privacy and security, which shall be provided by the educational agency prior to the commencement of the agreement, and a requirement that any officers or employees of Edpuzzle and its assignees who have access to student, teacher or principal data have received or will receive training on the federal and state law governing confidentiality of such data prior to receiving access.In attention to the foregoing, Edpuzzle hereby commits to:

- (1) limit internal access to education records to those individuals that are determined to have legitimate educational interests (e.g., Edpuzzle employees or third-party service providers);
- (2) not use the education records for any other purposes than those explicitly authorized in the Agreement (i.e., our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy);
- (3) except for authorized representatives of Edpuzzle to the extent they are carrying out the agreement, not disclose any personally identifiable information to any other party: (i) without the prior written consent of the parent or eligible student; or (ii) unless required by statute or court order and Edpuzzle provides a notice of the disclosure to the department, district board of education, or institution that provided the information no later than the time the information is disclosed, unless providing notice of the disclosure is expressly prohibited by the statute or court order;
- (4) maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of personally identifiable student information in its custody;
- (5) use encryption technology to protect data while in motion or in its custody from unauthorized disclosure using a technology or methodology specified by the secretary of the United States department of health and human services in guidance issued under Section 13402(H)(2) of Public Law 111-5; and
- (6) notify the educational agency, in the most expedient way possible and without unreasonable delay, but no more than seven (7) calendar days after the discovery of such breach, of any breach of security resulting in an unauthorized release of student, teacher or principal data, as outlined in applicable State and Federal laws.

The NY State Education Department makes available to educational agencies a Model Data Privacy Agreement. If you wish to use this Model Data Privacy Agreement, please forward it to privacy@edpuzzle.com. Edpuzzle will then review the document and propose any necessary revisions.
